You will need to fill in the vacant username and password entries in the tts.rb file before you can run it. You will specifically need a username and password for the text-to-speech service. Please note that service credentials are different than Bluemix account credentials.

To get service credentials, follow these steps:
 1. Log in to Bluemix at https://bluemix.net. If you don't have an account, sign up [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/) for a 30-day free trial.

 2. Create an instance of the service:
     1. In the Bluemix **Catalog**, scroll down to Services and select the Text to Speech service from **Watson**.
     2. Under **Add Service**, type a unique name for the service instance in the Service name field. For example, type `my-service-name`. Leave the default values for the other options.
     3. Click **Create**.

 3. Copy your credentials:
     1. On the left side of the page, click **Service Credentials** to view your service credentials.
     2. Copy `username` and `password` from these service credentials and paste them into the example.rb file.
     
 4. Run the example.rb file
